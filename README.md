# Flags of Switzerland for KSP
This pack contains all swiss flags in KSP format.

## A word about authenticity
The KSP format for flags doesn't really match with real flags so I had to ajust them as clean as I could. Some of them might have two or three pixels cut here and there, generally because the items on the concerned flag is close to the edge. It should'nt be that much visible though.

## Licensing, crediting and all these things
I don't see any reason to license this flag pack because I'm not the one who made the original flags. I just downloaded them and adjusted to the KSP format.

Use them as you wish. Credits would be apreciated. That's all folks.
